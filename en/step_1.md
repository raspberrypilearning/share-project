If you are in a club, why not share your project with friends?

You could also send a link to your family to show them how your project works. 

**Important:** Before you share your project, make sure that your project doesn't contain any personal information.

To get a link, go to the 'Share' menu button in the upper-right of your Trinket's edit page. Select 'Link'.

**Tip:** You can share a link to your project even if you don't have a Trinket account. But this means the link to your project changes each time you update it. If you have shared the link with someone, you need to send a new link for them to see the changes.
